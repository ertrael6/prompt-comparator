# AI Prompt Comparator (with API key form)

This app lets you compare responses from multiple LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral). 
On first run, it will prompt you in the web UI to enter your API keys before you can use the tool. 
Keys are stored in `.env` (never hardcoded in code).

## Usage

1. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run comparator/app.py
   ```
3. On first run, enter your API keys in the form. They are stored locally in `.env`.
4. Compare models side by side!
